# synth-keyboard

This is a simple synth keyboard based on this [MDN's example](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Simple_synth).
It was done with all the tedium of a day in Grandma's house without internet connection... :sleepy:

This example demonstrates a simple and cool usage of the Web API `Audio Context`.

For now you can only play the notes `Do-Re-Mi-Fa-Sol-La-Si`.
I'll probably implement it when things get boring again...

Enjoy the music ~~if your creativity allows~~! :notes:
